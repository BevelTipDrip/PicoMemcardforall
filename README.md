# PicoMemcardforall
This is an evolving collection of PCBs and 3D printable shell based off of the PicoMemcard+ project. This project offers a handfull of easilly assembled PCBs for a variety of devboards, these PCBs fit inside a 3D printed shell that mimmicks the footprint of the stock PS1 memory card.

The Goal of this project to make aesthetically pleasing, easilly accesible, and inexpensive Picomemcard+ assemblies.

The Zero and Xiao 2040 fit into the same shell, the PCBs themselves are near identical barring the footprint. Moving forward I plan to adapt a few more devboards to this project, boards I'm looking into include the Tiny 2040, 2040 Stamp, and the Adafruit QT Py RP2040. I'm also working on a dedicated PCB that uses the RP2040 IC directly on the board, Idealy this can be ordered near fully assembled and the SC0914 (RP2040 IC) is all that needs to be soldered on.
